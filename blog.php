                            <p>A very elderly man with a large packet in his hands always comes by our apartment block every morning. The whole courtyard comes alive when he shows up; all the local cats and their kittens run up to him from all directions, purring and rubbing his legs. He tries to give some of his attention to each one of the animals, petting them, talking to them. Then he goes to their bowls scattered underneath the nearby trees, cleans them, ladles out some pet food from his packet, and pours some milk and fresh water. And then the whole crowd of cats scampers over to have breakfast. His wife, who prepares the food, keeps watching him all the time from the window. Both of them are in their seventies, and they set aside part of their pensions every month for cat food and other treats for the cats. He comes to feed them every day, rain or shine. Whenever I see him, I want to thank him with all my heart, because he does not just help all the stray pets, but he has also changed the way our neighbours treat them, too. Many were inspired to start feeding them as well, some are even trying to find homes for them. There is kindness in this world!.</p>
